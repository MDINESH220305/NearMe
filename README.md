            Pulhal Lake, or Pulhal aeri, sometimes spelled Puzhal lake and also known as the Red Hills Lake, is located in Red Hills, Chennai, India. It lies in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu state. It is one of the two rain-fed reservoirs that supply water to Chennai City, the other one being the Chembarambakkam Lake and Porur Lake.
            The Pulhal reservoir was built in 1876 during the British rule in Pulhal, Chennai (named Madras at the time). The reservoir was originally a small tank with a capacity of 500 million cubic feet (mcft) and two masonry weirs, built using locally available laterite stones, then functioned as surplus weirs to release excess water from the water body. Today, these masonry weirs are water-retaining structures as they have been replaced by two shutters. In 1997, the storage capacity of the water reservoir was increased to 3,300 mcft and the depth to 21.20 ft to cater to the drinking water needs of Chennai and also to store Penna river water received from Andhra Pradesh through Poondi Reservoir and the Sholavaram Tank.

            Chennai the movie capital of South India with its large consumption of movie content & it very own film industry is a market in want of more screens for its consumers. The Galaxy Mall itself is located in the densely populated Red Hills town zone. The multiplex on the topmost level of the mall culminates the vertical circulation into its pre-function space. The design begins by creating an arrival experience with media walls playing movie trailers & the main entrance with a canopy announcing the cinemas.

The interior concept has been inspired with the classical dance form of bharat natyam. The ceiling designs with its pleat fold formation like the saree & cove lights in mudra position create a context relevant to the regional outpost. A series of design motifs were evolved to flow into the counter fascia, doors & take cues in the chandelier. The design challenge was always to create an interest in purity of spaces with robust finishes which are simple in detail while it continues to have its own signature style.
